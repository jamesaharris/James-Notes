# Why Does Plastic Pollution Float or Sink?

**Driving Question:** Why does some plastic pollution float near the surface while others sink towards the bottom?

### Part One: What makes an object float or sink?

- Open the float or sink simulation located in Google Classroom and begin the activity by pressing play. Then, answer the following questions.  

- What happened to the hook when it was placed in the water without a sinker? 

  - Its Floats on top of the water.

- Why was a sinker necessary in order to catch a fish? 

   - The fish need to see the bait.

### Part Two: Can you find or create a material that would be a good sinker? 

- Notice how the model changes when you adjust the mass. Define mass. What are the units for mass? 

  - Mass is the amount of material. Its measured in grams or kilograms.

- Notice how the model changes when you adjust the volume. Define volume. What are the units for volume?

  - Volume is the amount of space for the mass to take up. It is measured in milliliters and liters.

- What happens to the sinker if you increase the mass while keeping the volume constant? How does it change the density? How does it change if you decrease the mass? 

  - With a constant volume the sinker tends to sink with an increase in mass and raise with a decrease showing a positive correlation. 

- What is the relationship between mass and density? In other words, as mass increases what happens to the density? 

  - When you increase mass density also increases. 

- What happens to the sinker if you increase the volume while keeping the mass constant? How does it change the density? 

  - The sinker raises when you increase the volume and sinks when you decrease the volume showing a negative correlation. 

- What is the relationship between volume and density? In other words, as volume increases what happens to the density? 

  - As volume increases density decreases. There is a negative correlation.
