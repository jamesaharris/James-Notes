A Plot diagram is how the author arranges events to develop his basic idea; it's the sequence of events in a story. 
The short story usually has ONE plot, so it can be read in one sitting.

Setting is the time and location in which a story takes place. 
In addition to time and place, it may also include weather conditions, social conditions, and mood/atmosphere.
